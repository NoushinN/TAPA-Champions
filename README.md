# Code Hack, Island Healthâ€™s first hackathon 
This project was part of an intense 24-hour [Code.Hack hackathon](https://www.islandhealth.ca/about-us/accountability/innovation/code-hack) organized by Island Health on March 8-10, 2019, on grounds of Royal Jubilee Hospital, Victoria, BC. The guidelines and rules of Code.Hack are [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/TAPA-Champions/blob/master/code-hack-participant-package-2019.pdf).  
 
**TAPAChamions** team consisted of a nurse (Code Blue), healthcare manager (Code Blue), patient (Code Red), industry consultants (Code Yellow), and a data scientist (Code Yellow).
We competed against the clock to solve one of the most challenging healthcare problems we identified.  

Specifically, our team identified a challenge chroninc patients face in storing and managing their medical records. 
We proposed an innovative cloud-based solution to enable _transferrable_, _accessible_, _personal archives_ in order to alleviate the burden of carrying all medical records physically from one care provider to another. Please find the details of our solution in our [presentation](https://github.com/NoushinN/TAPA-Champions/blob/master/TAPAChampions-presentation.pdf).
