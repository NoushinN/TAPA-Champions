# Code Hack, Island Healthâ€™s first hackathon (March 8-10, 2019)
This project was part of an intense 24-hour event where our of nurses, healthcare management, patients, industry consultants,
designers, and students competed against the clock to solve one of the most challenging healthcare problems we identified.

Our team identified the challenge chroninc patients face in storing and managing their medical records. 
We proposed an innovative cloud-based solution to enable transferrable, accessible, personal archives in order to alleviate the burden
of carrying all medical records physically from one care provider to another.
