# Code Hack, Island Healthâ€™s first hackathon 
This project was part of an intense 24-hour [Code.Hack hackathon](https://www.islandhealth.ca/about-us/accountability/innovation/code-hack) organized by Island Health on March 8-10, 2019. The guidelines and rules of Code.Hack are [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/TAPA-Champions/blob/master/code-hack-participant-package-2019.pdf).  
 
TAPAChamions team consisted of a nurse, healthcare manager, patient, industry consultants, and data scientist.
We competed against the clock to solve one of the most challenging healthcare problems we identified.  

Specifically, our team identified a challenge chroninc patients face in storing and managing their medical records. 
We proposed an innovative cloud-based solution to enable transferrable, accessible, personal archives in order to alleviate the burden
of carrying all medical records physically from one care provider to another. Please find the details of our solution in our [presentation](https://github.com/NoushinN/TAPA-Champions/blob/master/TAPAChampions-presentation.pdf).
